## 🧑‍💻 Development & Customization

1. **Clone this repo**
2. **Customize the styles** in `styles.css`
3. **Modify layout or JS** if needed
4. **Deploy to Netlify** and connect a domain

## 🧠 Notes

- You'll need to enable **Netlify Identity** and **Git Gateway** for Decap CMS to function correctly.
- **Everything is editable via the CMS**, so no coding is required once it’s deployed. You can manage content like news, slideshows, and more directly from the admin panel.
